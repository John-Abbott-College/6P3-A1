    - Notes: I used the graphing functionality under the Visualizing Data section. My changes involved changing the x and y variables, as well as using a locally saved csv file. I also took code from the tutorial for a basic layout and altered the title and content.

    - date of retrieval: April 12, 2014
    - Notes: I used a part of the countdown code, namely the interval and the inputs/outputs of its callback, however I made my own update, customized the interval time, and I put my own functionality in the callback.

    - date of retrieval: April 12, 2014
    - Notes: I used the code for creating a button, as well as the functionality for input and output of its callback, and altered it to fit the goal of activating my sensors and actuators. I also took a note of the use of n_clicks as a value for conditional operations.
