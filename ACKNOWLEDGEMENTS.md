## Sources

1. I used chatgpt in order to pretty up my graph. I also used Chatgpt to help debug certain issues such as "GPIO Busy" errors PT3 / PT4.

2. I looked at Yensan's repository for part 1 because I was having trouble understanding certain requirements. I didn't copy his code fully however, I did use certain parts which made
sense to me PT1.

3. Used basic syntax from the dash.plotly tutorial which helped me better understand what I was doing PT3 / PT4.
